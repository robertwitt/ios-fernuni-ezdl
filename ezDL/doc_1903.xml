        <docAbstract>Much has been published on the theories of information retrieval and various means of handling and expediting the ever-growing accumulations of information which are swamping our civilization. Not much has been said, however, about any attempt to make use of a small to medium scale computer as a tool. This is an eighteen months' progress report of such an attempt undertaken at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory by a team consisting of computer people and librarians.
